Thread Broadcaster is a Single Channel Multi-Producer (SPMC) library that enables the sending of notifications between threads. Unlike most Multi-Producer Multi-Consumer (MPMC) implementations, Thread Broadcaster ensures that all listeners receive the data, rather than just the first one.

## ü§î Features

- Single Channel Multi-Producer (SPMC) architecture
- Tad bit faster than MPMC (thanks to [crossbeam-channel](https://crates.io/crates/crossbeam-channel)!)
- Senders and Receivers can be cloned and shared among threads.
- Simple and intuitive API for sending and receiving notifications
- Asynchronous notification broadcasting between threads
- Support `tracing` for debugs

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart

```rust
use core::time;
use std::thread;

use thread_broadcaster::{BroadcastListener, Broadcaster};

fn main() {
    let (b, s) = Broadcaster::<String>::new();
    let s2 = s.clone();
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let ls1 = BroadcastListener::register_broadcast_listener(s);
        for msg in ls1.channel {
            println!(
                "got broadcast with data: {} on thread {:#?}",
                msg,
                thread::current().id()
            );
        }
    });
    thread::spawn(move || {
        let ls2 = BroadcastListener::register_broadcast_listener(s2);
        for msg in ls2.channel {
            println!(
                "got broadcast with data: {} on thread {:#?}",
                msg,
                thread::current().id()
            );
        }
    });
    thread::spawn(move || {
        // we wait for registration
        thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_secs(1));
        b.broadcast("something to broadcast".to_string());
        // we wait for listeners to pickup before being dropped
        thread::sleep(time::Duration::from_secs(2));
    })
    .join()
    .unwrap();
}
```
